# GSoC Organization Application

## Why does your org want to participate in GSoC?

The Ruby org provides an umbrella organization for both the open source Ruby programming language and for numerous developer tools, libraries, and other projects written in Ruby. We want to participate in GSoC in order to grow the Ruby open source development community and help students get involved in open source in general. Students will get to develop their programming and project management skills, meet other project maintainers, get exposed to what's happening in the Ruby OS community, and see how their work helps others in the Ruby community. We provide a space for different parts of the Ruby ecosystem with a variety of challenges, to come together, collaborate, and provide the opportunity for students to participate in a wider community and diverse set of projects than in a single software project.

## How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

6-10

We have 10 potential mentors this year and hope to increase that number during the application period.

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

Every mentor-student relationship is different, but our mentors stay in daily contact with their students via Slack. Students not only provide regular updates, but are encouraged to keep up an open line of communication with their mentors, asking questions when they are stuck and continuosly refining their project design (since no PRD survives contact with code). Mentors provide regular feedback to their students, not waiting until the formal feedback periods to help the students grow as open source contributors. We also have weekly group meetings that students and mentors attend to share their weekly progress.

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

Mentors will evaluate daily and weekly progress and guide their students focus on completing the most important parts of their projects by providing them with context, assistance in navigating large codebases, brainstorming solutions, etc. Additionally, mentors will adjust the project scope based on the students ability and progress, by starting with minimum viable feature implementations and then if time allows, expand to building out more features. This way the student is not overwhelmed during the development and will be happy they accomplished a full implementation by end of the summer.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

We have a GSoC slack channel that students and mentors can join prior to submitting their applications to learn more about the projects and each other. We expect students to spend that time exploring the codebase they'll be working in. Mentors, students, and other contributors are all available to the students from the community bonding period onwards. We do a weekly meeting with everyone during GSoC so each student can share with others about the work they are doing and promote cross collaboration. Students are expected to work like any other open source contributor, and experience that responsibility.

## How will you keep your students involved in your community after GSoC?

We do our best to get students work merged upstream before the end of the summer, giving them a sense of pride and accomplishment with their work on the project. Students are encouraged to take on other open feature development for the project they worked on or any other Ruby project they desire. We have a open Slack channel where they know they can reach out to for help, ask questions, and get connected to other maintainers. We found that because they've spent a summer acting as a contributor for a project, they're able to continue contributing as members of the community.

## Has your org been accepted as a mentor org in GSoC before?

Yes.

## Which years did you participate in GSoC?

2015, 2016, 2018, 2019.

## For each year your org has participated, provide the counts of successful and total students:

- 2015: 6/10
- 2016: 9/12
- 2018: 5/6
- 2019: 5/6

## If your org has applied for GSoC before but not been accepted, select the years:

None

## Provide a reference: (optional)

Intentionally left blank since we're not a first-time org

## What year was your project started?

1995

The Ruby language had its first release in 1995, RubyGems was created during a Ruby conference in 2004, and Bundler saw its first release in 2009.

## Where does your source code live?

https://github.com/ruby, https://github.com/bundler, https://github.com/rubygems

## Anything else we should know?

This is an umbrella project that has successfully overseen GSoC projects across the Ruby ecosystem over the summers for 4 years. We've also been successful in converting former students to mentors and contributors, which is an incredible fulfilling experience.
